## Philosophy & Target Audience

toxiclibs provides computational design primitives:
- Geometry and mesh operations
- Physics simulation (Verlet)
- Color theory (TColor)
- Data structures
- Audio analysis

Target audience: Processing/Java users needing advanced math/geometry.

## Key Modules

- **toxi.geom** — Geometry (vectors, shapes, meshes)
- **toxi.physics** — Verlet physics
- **toxi.color** — Color theory
- **toxi.math** — Math utilities

## Study Questions

- [ ] How is the geometry library structured?
- [ ] How does the Verlet physics simulation work?
- [ ] How does TColor implement color theory?
- [ ] What data structures are provided?
- [ ] How does it integrate with Processing?
