# Per-Framework Notes

Deep-dive documentation for each creative coding framework.

## Frameworks

| Framework | Language | Status | Description |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| [p5.js](./p5js/) | JavaScript | Complete | Beginner-friendly, immediate-mode canvas |
| [nannou](./nannou/) | Rust | Partial | Rust-native creative coding |
| [drawbot](./drawbot/) | Python | Partial | Typography-focused, macOS, print-quality output |
| [openrndr](./openrndr/) | Kotlin | Planned | Modern JVM with DSL patterns |
| [processing](./processing/) | Java | Planned | Original creative coding framework |
| [openframeworks](./openframeworks/) | C++ | Planned | Native with addon ecosystem |
