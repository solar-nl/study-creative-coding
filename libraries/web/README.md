# Web Libraries

JavaScript libraries for browser-based graphics rendering.

## Libraries

| Library | Focus | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| [threejs](./threejs/) | 3D | WebGL/WebGPU scene graph and rendering |
| [pixijs](./pixijs/) | 2D | High-performance WebGL 2D renderer |
| [babylonjs](./babylonjs/) | 3D | Full-featured WebGL/WebGPU game engine |

## Common Patterns

All three libraries target WebGL (and increasingly WebGPU) but differ in scope:

- **three.js** — Focused 3D library with scene graph, widely used
- **PixiJS** — Optimized for 2D sprites, UI, and games
- **Babylon.js** — Full engine with physics, audio, XR support
